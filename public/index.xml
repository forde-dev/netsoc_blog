      <description>Building Netsoc Admin (#1) â€“ Development Tools Introduction Last September we (UCC Netsoc) installed two servers and dedicated one of them specifically to servicing our members and their applications.

After a month of looking at web panels and various solutions, it was apparent that what we wanted didnâ€™t exist in a pre-built package unfortunately.</description>
